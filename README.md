# About aws-kube development sandbox

This is a [development sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)) for deployment and testing of a simplified native Kubernetes cluster using EC2 images in AWS. This is used for development purposes and exposes you to some technologies that you might expect in prodcution like environments. To keep costs down it only uses services that are  essential for setting up and managing a Kubernetes cluster. 

This was originally developed to get experience with deploying and managing a Kubernetes cluster that is highly repeatable. It was desgined so that it could be spun up and destroyed quickly to save expenses running the resources in AWS. 

This was created as a two phase project:
* This first phase was to create a native Kubernetes infrastucture in AWS using popular platform engineering tools. 
* The second part (*work in progress*) is to setup a CI/CD pipeline for building an deploying images on the Kuberetes cluster.

# How to use this project

There are four directories used for different files and code.
Each of the diretories has it's own **README** file that gives specific instructions.
These are designed to used in the order the appear in the table below.

|Step|Directory|Description|
|---|---|--|
|**1**|aws-kube-shared        |Location of shared variables for Packer and Ansible |
|**2**|aws-kube-ansible-builds|Test the Ansible code locally using Vagrant|
|**3**|aws-kube-tf-packer    |Create the AWS VPC to build AMI Images using Terraform |
|**4**|aws-kube-ansible-builds|Use Packer to build your AMI images|
|**5**|aws-kube-tf-packer    |Destroy the AWS VPC to build AMI Images|
|**6**|aws-kube-tf-kubernetes |Use Terraform to build an AWS VPC to spin up a Kubernetes cluster using the AMI Images.|

**Next Steps**
* Log in to the Bastion Host
* Log in to the Kube Controller
* Play in the sandbox. Be courages and break things. It is the best way to learn. Besides that you can always destroy the environment and start over.


# Instructions for setting up your environment

* Make sure you have a publically routable IPv6 on your workstation (see [About IPv6](#about-ipv6-in-this-environment) below). 
* Add your public SSH key in *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub*. This public key is added to your AMIs to log in to. 
* Add your [shared AWS credential file](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#shared-configuration-and-credentials-files) at *~/.aws/credentials*. This allows Terraform to build your environment in AWS.  

  ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id=<your aws access key>
    aws_secret_access_key=<your aws secret key>
  ```

# Framework parameters that were in scope for this project

   * Note: The AWS AMI images are stored on AWS even after the VPCs are destroyed.
* All AWS instances are reachable from a single bastion host.


# Out of Scope parameters
* Redundancy of the environment. 
* More to come.

# Prerequsites and versions

There is nothing worse than downloading code and running it, only to find out that something breaks and the old resources are no longer avaiable. This is a good reason to  build your own AMI images and artifacts (config files etc.). An example of this pattern emerged while I was building **aws-kube** environment. The Calico network file moved. For this reason, I downloaded the Calico file to be able to repeat the build reliably .

I am listing exact versions that were used to build this enviroment. 

|Software|Version|
|---|---|
|Vagrant|2.3.4|
|Ansible|2.14.3|
|Packer|1.86|
|Packer Amazon Plugin|0.0.2|
|Terrform|1.4.2|
|Vagrant Ubuntu Image|ubuntu/jammy64|
|AWS Ubuntu Image|ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*|
|Kubernetes packages|kubeadm=1.26.3-00<br/>kubelet=1.26.3-00<br/>kubectl=1.26.3-00|

# Costs and Timing

## Timing
Generally the most time consuming piece is setting up your workspace environment (Terraform, AWS, Ansible, Packer and Vagrant) in addition to setting up tasks such your credenitals to allow Terraform to work with AWS. 

Once your workspace environment is setup, you can generally be up and running in AWS in a couple of hours that includes 

|Process|Timing|
|---|---|
|Building the two test Vagrant builds|~03:30 min: Build<br/>~00:09 min: Destroy|
|Creating and destroying the Packer VPC|~02:30 min: Build<br/>~01:00 min: Destroy|
|Building the two Kuberentes AMIs in the Packer VPC|~08:00: min each|
|Creating and destroying the Kubernetes VPC|~02:30 min: Build<br/>~01:00 min: Destroy|

After the two AMIs are built and stored in AWS, you will only need to *Create and destroy the Kubernetes VPC*, unless you want to make changes to the AMIs. 


## Costs

My AWS costs for the month I was building (~10 times) the VPCs and resources cost me approximately $5(USD). This does not include the cost of storing the AMIs or running the AWS resources for extended periods of time. Of course your costs may vary. From my perspective, investing in my career and devlopment is definitely worth the cost of a couple of lattes at my favorite caf√©. Remember to destroy your VPCs when not in use. 

### Keep costs down

Things to remember to keep costs down:
* Delete the Snapshots for the AMI images after de-registering the AMIs. They do not get deleted automatically.
* Destroy the VPCs with Terraform when not in use. 



# About IPv6 in this environment

I should probably write a blog about my full experience with this. 
If you are lucky enough to have an Internet Service Provider that automatically provides you with routable IPv6, then you should be good to go. 

It might be tempting to search Google for `What is my IP` to see if you are using IPv6. In some cases, Google will not provide your IPv6 address even though you may have an IPv6 address. For what it is worth, [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) will not provide your IPv6 address either. 

The best way of seeing if you have an IPv6 address is to run: `curl -S ipv6.icanhazip.com` or going to http://ipv6.icanhazip.com. ipv6.icanhazip.com does not have an IPv4 DNS entry so don't expect it work if you are only using IPv4. Use http://ipv4.icanhazip.com if you want to see your IPv4 address.

The provided Terraform code runs `curl -S ipv6.icanhazip.com` to get your IPv6 address and `curl -S ipv4.icanhazip.com` to get your IPv4 address. These IP addresses are used to limit access to you bastion hosts to those two IP addresses.


## What if I don't have an IPv6 address? 

There are some VPN services that offer IPv6. Most of the popular VPNs don't offer IPv6. 
Here are a few VPNs that offer IPv6 in no paticular order:
* [Hideme](hide.me)
* [Perfect Privacy](www.perfect-privacy.com)
* [airvpn.org](airvpn)

**Disclaimer:** I am not paid for listing these VPN providers nor do I endorse any particular provider. 

There are a few other VPN Services that offer IPv6 addresses that are not listed here. It should be noted that the field of VPN services offering IPv6 was rather limited when I was testing this in early 2023. For reference I **do** use perfect-privacy. I can't attest to whether perfect-privacy has perfect privacy on not. I was able to get IPv6 which suited my needs. 

**NOTE:** I was **NOT** able to get an IPv6 address using the VPN app provided by Perfect Privacy. I ended up using the native Mac VPN (IKEv2) to connect to the Perfect Privacy servers and I was able to get an IPv6 address. I spent a lot of time trying to figure this all out so I hope this information is helpful. 

## Backstory on using IpV6

I was initially setting up this environment for myself. I also wanted to get exposure to IPv6. At the time I was using Xfinity for my internet. Xfinity was using a NAT'd IPv6 on my router. I moved away from Xfinity and the new provider did not "support" IPv6. I wanted a quick way to keep working with IPv6 without having to fix the Terraform code at the time.
